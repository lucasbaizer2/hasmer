# What is hasmer?

hasmer is a utility for working with [Hermes](https://github.com/facebook/hermes) bytecode.

hasmer can disassemble bytecode of any Hermes version into a human and machine-readable format called Hasm (i.e. Hermes + assembly).

## Things that are still WIP (i.e. not yet working fully)

hasmer can assemble Hasm files back into Hermes bytecode files, allowing you to edit the disassembly of a Hermes file and then assemble your changes back into bytecode.

hasmer also has a decompiler, which decompiles Hermes bytecode into JavaScript.

You can find detailed documentation and other various information regarding usage of hasmer on the [hasmer website](https://lucasbaizer2.github.io/hasmer).
