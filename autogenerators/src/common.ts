 *
 * When hasmer is disassembling a file (and the `--exact` option is omitted),
 * it takes all variant instructions and converts them into an abstracted form (i.e. this structure).
 *
 * As an example, the abstracted form of the variants `NewObjectWithBuffer` and `NewObjectWithBufferLong` is `NewObjectWithBuffer`.
 * To the perspective of the programmer, `NewObjectWithBuffer` has arbitrary length operands.
 *
 * When hasmer then assembles that file, the assembler does optimizations itself to determine which variant should be used,
 * based on the operands that were passed to it.
 *
 * We do this because it would be painstakingly difficult for the programmer to figure out which operand to use.
